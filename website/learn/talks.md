### Fluss: A Streaming Storage for Real-Time Lakehouse
**Jark Wu** • Carnegie Mellon Future Data Systems Seminar Series 2025 • December 2025

This seminar session explores Fluss as the foundation of a Streaming Lakehouse model, where real-time data in Fluss and historical data in Lakehouse (Iceberg) are seamlessly unified for truly real-time analytics. Built on Apache Arrow, Fluss provides the columnar streaming storage and sub-second ingestion that make this unified model possible.

### The Seven Deadly Sins of Streaming
**Giannis Polyzos** • Big Data Conference Europe 2025 • December 2025

Exploring the Streaming Lakehouse model—powered by Fluss’s columnar streaming storage—addresses the “Seven Deadly Sins of Streaming,” from redundant data copies and unqueryable streams to stale lakehouse data and costly architectures. By unifying streaming and lakehouse systems through streaming tables, Fluss enables real-time dashboards, streaming ETL, and Customer 360 use cases within a single, modern architecture that delivers fresher, more efficient real-time analytics.

### Streaming Down the Fluss: Taming CDC Streams with Fluss, Fluss, and Paimon
**Dominik Žnidaršič** • Flink Forward 2025 • November 2025

This session explores how real-time data processing extends far beyond ingestion, focusing on what happens after the CDC stream lands. It offers a practical look at building a real-time lakehouse pipeline by integrating Flink, Fluss, and Paimon to deliver fast, efficient, and usable end-to-end analytics.

### Fluss: Making Your Lakehouse Truly Real Time
**Jark Wu** • Flink Forward 2025 • November 2025

Exploring how Fluss bridges data streaming and the Lakehouse (Iceberg) by serving real-time data directly on top of it, enabling powerful analytics on streams while delivering low-latency updates to Iceberg—effectively transforming it into a Real-Time Lakehouse. We’ll close with real-world use cases that showcase how Fluss powers Real-Time Lakehouses and fuels the next generation of AI-driven applications.
