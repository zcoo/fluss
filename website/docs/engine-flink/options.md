# Connector Options

The following table lists the options that can be used to configure the Fluss table in Flink, including the storage format, the read/write behaviors.

## How to Configure Options

You can configure the Fluss table options in Flink SQL DDL statements. For example, the following SQL statement creates a Fluss table with the `table.log.ttl` set to 7 days:

### Configure options when creating a table

All the options in this page can be set when creating a table. Once a table is created, the defined options will be stored as a part of the metadata of the Fluss table. The stored options will be used when reading or writing the table.
For example, the following SQL statement creates a Fluss table with the `table.log.ttl` set to 7 days and disables the CRC check for the log reading:

```sql
CREATE TABLE log_table (
  order_id BIGINT,
  item_id BIGINT,
  amount INT,
  address STRING
) WITH (
  'table.log.ttl' = '7d',
  'client.scanner.log.check-crc' = 'false'
);
```


### Dynamically apply options via SQL hints

You can dynamically apply the options via SQL hints. The dynamically applied options will not be stored as metadata of the table.
They will only be used for the current query and will not affect other queries on the table. The dynamically applied options have a higher priority than the options stored in the metadata of the table.

:::note
The [Storage Options](#storage-options) doesn't supported to be dynamically configured via SQL hints, because the storage behavior is determined when the table is created.
:::

For example, the following SQL statements temporarily disables the CRC check for the log reading and ignores deletes for writing:

```sql
-- SQL hints on source tables
SELECT * FROM log_table /*+ OPTIONS('client.scanner.log.check-crc' = 'false') */;

-- SQL hints on sink tables
INSERT INTO pk_table2 /*+ OPTIONS('sink.ignore-delete'='true') */ select * from pk_table1;
```


### Reconfigure options by altering table

Using `ALTER TABLE ... SET` statement to modify the table options. For example, to enable lakehouse storage for an existing table, you can run the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE log_table SET ('table.datalake.enable' = 'true');
```

See more details about [ALTER TABLE ... SET](engine-flink/ddl.md#set-properties) and [ALTER TABLE ... RESET](engine-flink/ddl.md#reset-properties) documentation.

Auto-partitioning utilizes a time-based partition key to handle partitions automatically, including creating new ones and removing outdated ones, by comparing the time value of the partition with the current system time. In the case of a table using multiple partition keys (such as a composite partitioning strategy), this feature determines which key should serve as the primary time dimension for making auto-partitioning decisions. And If the table has only one partition key, this config is not necessary. Otherwise, it must be specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If any one partition exists, it'll skip creating the partition. The default value is 2, which means 2 partitions will be pre-created.

A value larger than the number of tablet servers in Fluss cluster will result in an error when the new table is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Currently, supported formats are `paimon`, `iceberg`, and `lance`. In the future, more kinds of data lake format will be supported, such as DeltaLake or Hudi. Once the `table.datalake.format` property is configured, Fluss adopts the key encoding and bucketing strategy used by the corresponding data lake format. This ensures consistency in key encoding and bucketing, enabling seamless **Union Read** functionality across Fluss and Lakehouse. The `table.datalake.format` can be pre-defined before enabling `table.datalake.enabled`. This allows the data lake feature to be dynamically enabled on the table without requiring table recreation. If `table.datalake.format` is not explicitly set during table creation, the table will default to the format specified by the `datalake.format` configuration in the Fluss cluster. |

| table.delete.behavior                   | Enum     | ALLOW                               | Controls the behavior of delete operations on primary key tables. Three modes are supported: `ALLOW` (default) - allows normal delete operations; `IGNORE` - silently ignores delete requests without errors; `DISABLE` - rejects delete requests and throws explicit errors. This configuration provides system-level guarantees for some downstream pipelines (e.g., Flink Delta Join) that must not receive any delete events in the changelog of the table. For tables with `first_row` or `versioned` merge engines, this option is automatically set to `IGNORE` and cannot be overridden. Only applicable to primary key tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A non-positive value disables the partition discovery. The default value is 1 minute. Currently, since Fluss Admin#listPartitions(TablePath tablePath) requires a large number of requests to ZooKeeper in server, this option cannot be set too small, as a small value would cause frequent requests and increase server load.

| client.writer.dynamic-batch-size.enabled            | Boolean    | true              | Controls whether the client writer dynamically adjusts the batch size based on actual write throughput. Enabled by default. With dynamic batch sizing enabled, the writer adapts memory allocation per batch according to historical write sizes for the target table or partition. This ensures better memory utilization and performance under varying throughput conditions. The dynamic batch size is bounded: it will not exceed `client.writer.batch-size`, nor fall below `client.writer.buffer.page-size`. When disabled, the writer uses a fixed batch size (`client.writer.batch-size`) for all batches, this may lead to frequent memory waits and suboptimal write performance if the incoming data rate is inconsistent across partitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| client.writer.batch-timeout                         | Duration   | 100ms             | The writer groups ay rows that arrive in between request sends into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when rows arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the writer may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay, that is, rather than immediately sending out a row, the writer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get client.writer.batch-size worth of rows for a bucket it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this bucket we will delay for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. |

For table with bucket key or primary key, we choose a bucket based on a hash of the key. For these table without bucket key and primary key, we can use this option to specify bucket assigner, the candidate assigner is ROUND_ROBIN, STICKY, the default assigner is STICKY.<br/>ROUND_ROBIN: this strategy will assign the bucket id for the input row by round robin.<br/>STICKY: this strategy will assign new bucket id only if the batch changed in record accumulator, otherwise the bucket id will be the same as the front record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:<br/>acks=0: If set to 0, then the writer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. No guarantee can be mode that the server has received the record in this case.<br/>acks=1: This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledge the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.<br/>acks=-1 (all): This will mean the leader will wait for the full ser of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive, This is the strongest available guarantee.                                                                        |
